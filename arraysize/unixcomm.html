1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is my own summary of useful Linux abbreviations, directories, files, and
commands. I use my own annotations to recall useful options and arguments that
are not necessarily documented in easy-to-find places. I quite often call up
this file when I can't remember the syntax of a command that I use often (but
not often enough to remember the syntax!). I also editorialize on the relative
usefulness of different types of programs.

<p>
This document is work in progress. Send suggested changes and corrections to
<tt><a href="mailto:ambler.steven@uqam.ca">ambler.steven@uqam.ca</a></tt>

<p>
O'Reilly has just published online an alphabetical list of commands from
<em>Linux in a Nutshell</em>. It is available
<tt><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/linux/cmd/">here</a></tt>. It contains more
detailed explanations of many of the commands listed here.

<p>
       <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorthand at the Command Prompt</h2>

<p>
Some of these are specific to the bash shell. I have not experimented enough
with other shells to know which are common to all shells. See also the ``Bash
Reference Card'', SSC (2000), available online.

<p>

<ul>
<li> / - root directory

<p>

<li> ./ - current directory

<p>

<li> ./command_name - run a command in the current directory when the
current directory is not on the path

<p>

<li> ../ - parent directory

<p>

<li> <tt>~</tt> - home directory

<p>

<li> $ - typical prompt when logged in as ordinary user

<p>

<li> # - typical prompt when logged in as root or superuser

<p>

<li> ! - repeat specified command

<p>

<li> !! - repeat previous command

<p>

<li> <tt>^^</tt> - repeat previous command with substitution

<p>

<li> &amp; - run a program in background mode
  
<p>

<li> <tt>[Tab][Tab]</tt> - prints a list of all available commands. This is
  just an example of autocomplete with no restriction on the first letter.

<p>

<li> x[Tab][Tab] - prints a list of all available completions for a command,
  where the beginning is ``x''

<p>

<li> <tt>[Alt][Ctrl][F1]</tt> - switch to the first virtual text console
  
<p>

<li> <tt>[Alt][Ctrl][Fn]</tt> - switch to the n<sup>th</sup> virtual text console.
  Typically, there are six on a Linux PC system.

<p>

<li> <tt>[Alt][Ctrl][F7]</tt> - switch to the first GUI console, if there is
  one running. If the graphical console freezes, one can switch to a
  nongraphical console, kill the process that is giving problems, and switch
  back to the graphical console using this shortcut.

<p>

<li> <tt>[ArrowUp]</tt> - scroll through the command history (in bash)
  
<p>

<li> <tt>[Shift][PageUp]</tt> - scroll terminal output up. This also works at
  the login prompt, so you can scroll through your boot messages.

<p>

<li> <tt>[Shift][PageDown]</tt> - scroll terminal output down
  
<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][+]</tt> - switch to next X server resolution (if the
  server is set up for more than one resolution)

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][-]</tt> - change to previous X server resolution
  
<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][BkSpc]</tt> - kill the current X server. Used when normal
  exit is not possible.

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][Del]</tt> - shut down the system and reboot

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl]c</tt> - kill the current process

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl]d</tt> - logout from the current terminal

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl]s</tt> - stop transfer to current terminal

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl]q</tt> - resume transfer to current terminal. This should
be tried if the terminal stops responding.

<p>

<li> <tt>[Ctrl]z</tt> - send current process to the background

<p>

<li> reset - restore a terminal to its default settings

<p>

<li><tt>[Leftmousebutton]</tt> - Hold down left mouse button and drag to
highlight text. Releasing the button copies the region to the text buffer
under X and (if gpm is installed) in console mode.

<p>

<li><tt>[Middlemousebutton]</tt> - Copies text from the text buffer and inserts
it at the cursor location. With a two-button mouse, click on both
buttons simultaneously. It is necessary for three-button emulation to be
enabled, either under gpm or in XF86Config.

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical Dot Files</h2>

<p>
There is some redundancy across these programs. For example, the look and
behavior of emacs can be customized by usinng the .emacs file, but also by
adding the appropriate modifications to the .Xdefaults file. Default versions
of these files are often installed in users' home directories when the
software packages that use them are installed. If a program doesn't find its
configuration file in the user's home directory, it will often fall back on a
sytem-wide default configuration file installed in one of the subdirectories
that the package lives in.

<p>

<ul>
<li> .bash_logout - file executed by bash shell on logout
  
<p>

<li> .bash_profile - initialization of bash shell run only on login. Bash
  looks first for a .bash_profile file when started as a login shell or with
  the -login option. If it does not find .bash_profile, it looks for
  .bash_login. If it doesn't find that, it looks for .profile. System-wide
  functions and aliases go in /etc/bashrc and default environment variables go
  in /etc/profile.
  
<p>

<li> .bashrc - initialization command run when bash shell starts up as a
  non-login shell
  
<p>

<li> .cshrc - initialization commands that are run automatically (like
  autoexec.bat) when C shell is initiated

<p>

<li> .emacs - configuration file for emacs editor

<p>

<li> .fvwmrc - configuration file for fvwm window manager

<p>

<li> .fvwm2rc - configuration file for fvwm2 window manager

<p>

<li> .jedrc - configuration file for the jed text editor
  
<p>

<li> .lessrc - typically contains key bindings for cursor movement with the
  less command

<p>

<li> .login - initialization file when user logs in

<p>

<li> .logout - commands run when user logs out
  
<p>

<li> .wm_style - gives choice of default window manager if one is not
  specified in startx
  
<p>

<li> .Xdefaults - sets up X resources for individual user. The behavior of
  many different application programs can be changed by modifying this file.
  
<p>

<li> .xinitrc - initialization file when running startx. Can be used to
  activate applications, run a given window manager, and modify the appearance
  of the root window.

<p>

<li> .xsession - configuration file for xdm

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Useful Files</h2>

<p>

<ul>  
<li> /boot/vmlinuz - the typical location and name of the Linux kernel. In
  the Slackware distribution, the kernel is located at /vmlinuz.

<p>

<li> /dev/fd0 - first floppy disk drive
  
<p>

<li> /dev/fd0H1440 - driver for the first floppy drive in high density mode.
  Generally, this is invoked when formatting a floppy drive for a particular
  density. Slackware comes with drivers that allow for formatting a 3.5"
  diskette with up to 1.7MB of space. Red Hat and Mandrake do not contain
  these device driver files by default.

<p>

<li> /dev/fd1 - second floppy disk drive

<p>

<li> /dev/hda - first IDE hard drive

<p>

<li> /dev/hdc - on many machines, the IDE cdrom drive. Most often, there is
  a symbolic link called /dev/cdrom which is just a link to the true cdrom
  driver file.

<p>

<li> /dev/null - used when you want to send output into oblivion
  
<p>

<li> /etc/aliases - file containing aliases used by sendmail and other MTAs
  (mail transport agents). After updating this file, it is necessary to run
  the newaliases utility for the changes to be passed to sendmail.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/bashrc - system-wide default functions and aliases for the bash
  shell

<p>

<li> /etc/conf.modules - aliases and options for configurable modules

<p>

<li> /etc/crontab - shell script to run different commands periodically
  (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
  
<p>

<li> /etc/DIR_COLORS - used to store colors for different file types when
  using ls command. The dircolors command uses this file when there is not a
  .dir_colors file in the user's home directory. Used in conjunction with the
  eval command (see below).

<p>

<li> /etc/exports - specifies hosts to which file systems can be exported
  using NFS. Man exports contains information on how to set up this file for
  remote users.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/fstab - contains information on partitions and filesystems used by
  system to mount different partitions and devices on the directory tree

<p>

<li> /etc/HOSTNAME - stores the name of the host computer

<p>

<li> /etc/hosts - contains a list of host names and absolute IP addresses.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/hosts.allow - hosts allowed (by the tcpd daemon) to access
  Internet services
  
<p>

<li> /etc/hosts.deny - hosts forbidden (by the tcpd daemon) to access
  Internet services

<p>

<li> /etc/group - similar to /etc/passwd but for groups
  
<p>

<li> /etc/inetd.conf - configures the inetd daemon to tell it what TCP/IP
  services to provide (which daemons to load at boot time). A good start to
  securing a Linux box is to turn off these services unless they are
  necessary.

<p>

<li> /etc/inittab - runs different programs and processes on startup. This
  is typically the program which is responsible for, among other things,
  setting the default runlevel, running the rc.sysinit script contained in
  /etc/rc.d, setting up virtual login terminals, bringing down the system in
  an orderly fashion in response to <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][Del]</tt>, running the rc
  script in /etc/rc.d, and running xdm for a graphical login prompt (only if
  the default runlevel is set for a graphical login).
  
<p>

<li> /etc/issue - pre-login message. This is often overwitten by the
  /etc/rc.d/rc.S script (in Slackware) or by the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script (in
  Mandrake and Red Hat, and perhaps other rpm-based distributions). The
  relevant lines should be commented out (or changed) in these scripts if a
  custom pre-login message is desired.

<p>

<li> /etc/lilo.conf - configuration file for lilo boot loader
  
<p>

<li> /etc/motd - message of the day file, printed immediately after login.
  This is often overwritten by /etc/rc.d/rc.S (Slackware) or
  /etc/rc.d/rc.local (Mandrake/Red Hat) on startup. See the remarks in
  connection with /etc/issue.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/mtab - shows currently mounted devices and partitions and their
  status
  
<p>

<li> /etc/passwd - contains passwords and other information concerning users
  who are registered to use the system. For obvious security reasons, this is
  readable only by root. It can be modified by root directly, but it is
  preferable to use a configuration utility such as passwd to make the
  changes. A corrupt /etc/passwd file can easily render a Linux box unusable.

<p>

<li> /etc/printcap - shows the setup of printers
  
<p>

<li> /etc/profile - sets system-wide defaults for bash shell. It is this
  file in Slackware that sets up the DIR_COLORS environment variable for the
  color ls command. Also sets up other system-wide environment variables.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/resolv.conf - contains a list of domain name servers used by the
  local machine

<p>

<li> /etc/securetty - contains a list of terminals on which root can
  login. For security reasons, this should not include dialup terminals.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/termcap - ASCII database defining the capabilities and
  characteristics of different consoles, terminals, and printers

<p>

<li> /etc/X11/XF86Config - X configuration file. The location in Slackware
  is /etc/XF86Config.

<p>

<li> /proc/cpuinfo - cpu information

<p>

<li> /proc/filesystems - prints filesystems currently in use

<p>

<li> /proc/interrupts - prints interrupts currently in use
  
<p>

<li> /proc/ioports - contains a list of the i/o addresses used by various
  devices connected to the computer
  
<p>

<li> /proc/kcore - The command ls -l /proc/kcore will give the amount of RAM
  on the computer. It's also possible to use the free command to get the same
  information (and more).

<p>

<li> /proc/version - prints Linux version and other info
  
<p>

<li> /var/log/messages - used by syslog daemon to store kernel boot-time
  messages

<p>

<li> /var/log/lastlog - used by system to store information about last
boot

<p>

<li> /var/log/wtmp - contains binary data indicating login times and
duration for each user on system

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Important Directories</h2>

<p>
Different distributions have different directory structures, despite attempts
at standardization such as the the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
organization.

<p>

<ul>  
<li> /bin - essential UNIX commands such as ls, etc. Should contain all
  binaries needed to boot the system or run it in single-user mode
  
<p>

<li> /boot - files used during booting and possibly the kernel itself are
  stored here

<p>

<li> /dev - contains device files for various devices on system
  
<p>

<li> /etc - files used by subsystems such as networking, NFS, and mail.
  Includes tables of disks to mount, processes to run on startup, etc.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/profile.d - contains scripts that are run by /etc/profile upon
  login.

<p>

<li> /etc/rc.d - contains a number of shell scripts that are run on bootup
  at different run levels. There is also typically an rc.inet1 script to set
  up networking (in Slackwar), an rc.modules script to load modular device
  drivers, and an rc.local script that can be edited to run commands desired
  by the administrator, along the lines of autoexec.bat in DOS.

<p>

<li> /etc/rc.d/init.d - contains most of the initialization scripts
  themselves on an rpm-based system.

<p>

<li> /etc/rc.d/rc*.d - where ``*'' is a number corresponding to the default
  run level. Contains files for services to be started and stopped at that run
  level. On rpm-based systems, these files are symbolic links to the
  initialization scripts themselves, which are in /etc/rc.d/init.d.
  
<p>

<li> /etc/skel - directory containing several example or skeleton
  initialization shells. Often contains subdirectories and files used to
  populate a new user's home directory.

<p>

<li> /etc/X11 - configuration files for the X Window system

<p>

<li> /home - home directories of individual users

<p>

<li> /lib - standard shared library files

<p>

<li> /lib/modules - modular device driver files, most with .o extensions
  
<p>

<li> /mnt - typical mount point for many user-mountable devices such as
  floppy drives, cd-rom readers, etc. Each device is mounted on a subdirectory
  of /mnt.

<p>

<li> /proc - virtual file system that provides a number of system statistics

<p>

<li> /root - home directory for root

<p>

<li> /sbin - location of binaries used for system administration,
  configuration, and monitoring

<p>

<li> /tmp - directory specifically designed for programs and users to store
  temporary files.

<p>

<li> /usr - directory containing a number of subdirectory with programs,
  libraries, documentation, etc. 
  
<p>

<li> /usr/bin - contains most user commands. Should not contain binaries
  necessary for booting the system, which go in /bin. The /bin directory is
  generally located on the same disk partition as /, which is mounted in
  read-only mode during the boot process. Other filesystems are only mounted
  at a later stage during startup, so putting binaries essential for boot here
  is not a good idea.

<p>

<li> /usr/bin/X11 - most often a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/bin, which
  contains executable binaries related to the X Window system

<p>

<li> /usr/doc - location of miscellaneous documentation, and the main
  location of program documentation files under Slackware
  
<p>

<li> /usr/include - standard location of include files used in C programs
  such as stdio.h

<p>

<li> /usr/info - primary location of the GNU info system files
  
<p>

<li> /usr/lib - standard library files such as libc.a. Searched by the
  linker when programs are compiled.

<p>

<li> /usr/lib/X11 - X Window system distribution

<p>

<li> /usr/local/bin - yet another place to look for comon executables

<p>

<li> /usr/man - location of manual page files
  
<p>

<li> /usr/sbin - other commands used by superuser for system administration

<p>

<li> /usr/share - contains subdirectories where many installed programs have
  configuration, setup and auxiliary files

<p>

<li> /usr/share/doc - location of program documentation files under Mandrake
  and Red Hat
  
<p>

<li> /usr/src - location of source programs used to build system. Source
  code for programs of all types are often unpacked in this directory.

<p>

<li> /usr/src/linux - often a symbolic link to a subdirectory whose name
  corresponds to the exact version of the Linux kernel that is
  running. Contains the kernel sources.
  
<p>

<li> /var - administrative files such as log files, used by various
  utilities
  
<p>

<li> /var/log/packages - contains files, each of which has detailed
  information on an installed package in Slackware. The same file can also be
  found at /var/adm/packages, since the adm subdirectory is a symbolic link to
  log. Each package file contains a short description plus a list of all
  installed files.
  
<p>

<li> /var/log/scripts - package installation scripts in Slackware are stored
  here. You can inspect these scripts to see what special features are
  included in individual packages.
  
<p>

<li> /var/spool - temporary storage for files being printed, mail that has
  not yet been picked up, etc.

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Important Bash Shell Variables</h2>

<p>
These variables are most often inherited or declared when a shell is
started. A great reference for bash shell variable, bash builtin commands, and
bash in general is SSC (2000).

<p>

<ul>
<li> HOME - home directory, abbreviated as <tt>~</tt>

<p>

<li> MAIL - name of file that mail is stored in (<em>mailbox</em>)

<p>

<li> MAILCHECK - sets the frequency at which bash checks for mail
  
<p>

<li> PATH - directory paths to search for executable files. According to
  <em>A Practical Guide to Linux</em>, p.329, the PATH is set in /etc/profile.
  On my Linux box, /etc/profile adds /usr/X11R6/bin to the path, which means
  that the path must be set before by another configuration file. The
  .bash_profile file in my home directory adds /home/ambler/bin to the path.
  On my Linux box, the first command to set the path would seem to be in
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, which is one of the shell scripts invoked by the init
  process (inittab). Then, /etc/profile adds /usr/X11R6/bin. Finally,
  .bash_profile adds /home/ambler/bin.
  
<p>

<li> PS1 - prompt string. Things that can be put in the prompt string
  include <tt>\</tt>h (hostname), <tt>\</tt>u (username), <tt>\</tt>w (absolute
  pathname of working directory), <tt>\</tt>W (name of working directory w/o
  path), <tt>\</tt>d (date), <tt>\</tt>t (time). See p.331 of <em>A Practical
    Guide to Linux</em> for more details. On my Red Hat boxes, the primary prompt
  string is set in the /etc/bashrc file. The prompt is also set in
  /etc/profile, but the setting in bashrc seems to take precedence. I also
  have a .bashrc file, which in turn runs /etc/bashrc, which sets the prompt.
  This means that the same prompt is used by xterm and rxvt in X sessions. On
  my Slackware box, the command line prompt is set in /etc/profile. The xterm
  and rxvt prompts are different, since I don't have a .bash_profile file
  which is run when an xterm is started. In fact, I don't know where the
  prompt is set in X sessions. It is not set by
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.

<p>

<li> PS2 - secondary prompt string.

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc7">
7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Important Daemons and Startup Services</h2>

<p>
These are programs or processes which are run at boot time. Some remain in
memory to execute various tasks when required (daemons). Most are started and
stopped with scripts in the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory (see above). The exact
contents of this directory will depend on which packages from a particular
distribution are installed.  For example, installing the Apache package will
cause an httpd script to be placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

<p>
There are man pages on most of these. The Red Hat program tksysv (ntsysv is
the non graphical version) allows root to automatically configure which of
these are started automatically at boot time. The linuxconf program does the
same thing, although I haven't tried it. The utility chkconfig is also
designed to query and configure runtime services for different runlevels. The
<tt>www.mandrakeuser.org</tt> site has a good page on common services/daemons,
especially those included in recent versions of the Mandrake distribution.

<p>
A good source of information on daemons and services is the ``Linux Devices,
Daemons, Services'' chapter of the CTDP (2000a) document.

<p>

<ul>
<li> amd - runs the automount daemon for remote filesystem mounting such as
  nfs 
  
<p>

<li> anacron - checks delayed `cron' tasks (see below) at boot time and
  executes them. Useful if you have cron jobs scheduled but don't run your
  machine all the time.

<p>

<li> apmd - Advanced Power Management BIOS daemon. For use on machines,
especially laptops, that support apm. Monitors battery status and can shut
down the system if power is too low.

<p>

<li> arpwatch - keeps watch for ethernet IP address pairings that are
  resolved using the ARP protocol.

<p>

<li> atd - runs jobs queued by `at'

<p>

<li> autofs - control the operation of automount daemons, used to mount and
  unmount devices on demand
  
<p>

<li> bootparamd - allows computers to boot from a Linux machine using the
  BOOTP network protocol. A server process that provides information to
  diskless clients necessary for booting
  
<p>

<li> crond - automatic task scheduler. Manages the execution of tasks that
  are executed at regular but infrequent intervals, such as rotating log
  files, cleaning up /tmp directories, etc.
  
<p>

<li> cups - daemon for print services under the Common Unix Printer System,
  a replacement for lpd

<p>

<li> dhcpd - implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and
  the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). Used to lease out IP addresses to
  remote machines.

<p>

<li> drakfont - font server in Mandrake
  
<p>

<li> fetchmail - daemon to fetch mail at regular intervals from mail servers

<p>

<li> ftpd - ftp server daemon
  
<p>

<li> gated - routing daemon that handles multiple routing protocols and
  replaces routed and egpup

<p>

<li> gpm - useful mouse server for applications running on the Linux
  console.

<p>

<li> httpd - the Apache webserver hypertext transfer protocol daemon
  
<p>

<li> identd - The identd server provides a means to determine the identity
  of a user of a particular TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number pair, it
  returns a character string which identifies the owner of that connection on
  the server's system.
  
<p>

<li> inetd - listens for service requests on network connections,
  particularly <em>dial-in</em> services. This daemon can automatically load and
  unload other daemons (ftpd, telnetd, etc.), thereby economizing on system
  resources. In the latest version of Red Hat (7.0 at the time of writing), it
  has been replaced by xinetd. A partial list of services controlled by inetd
  is listed below. Under many distributions, inetd will execute scripts in the
  file /etc/inetd.conf.

<p>

<li> innd - Usenet news server daemon
  
<p>

<li> ipchains - daemon for packet forwarding. Used for configuring a
  gateway/firewall.

<p>

<li> isdn provides ISDN network interfacing services

<p>

<li> isdn4linux - for users of ISDN cards

<p>

<li> kerneld - automatically loads and unloads kernel modules
  
<p>

<li> keytable - loads the appropriate keyboard map from /etc/sysconfig/
  keyboard

<p>

<li> kheader -

<p>

<li> kudzu - detects and configures new or changed hardware during boot
  
<p>

<li> linuxconf - ``startup hook'' needed for the linuxconf system
  configuration tool

<p>

<li> lpd - line printer and print spooler daemon
  
<p>

<li> mcserv - server program for the Midnight Commander networking file
  system. It provides access to the host file system to clients running the
  Midnight file system (currently, only the Midnight Commander file manager).
  If the program is run as root the program will try to get a reserved port
  otherwise it will use 9876 as the port. If the system has a portmapper
  running, then the port will be registered with the portmapper and thus
  clients will automatically connect to the right port. If the system does not
  have a portmapper, then a port should be manually specified with the -p
  option (see below).

<p>

<li> mysql - database server daemon

<p>

<li> named - provides DNS services

<p>

<li> netfs - network filesystem mounter. Used for mounting nfs, smb and ncp 
shares on boot.

<p>

<li> network -activates all network interfaces at boot time by calling
  scripts in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

<p>

<li> nfsd - used for exporting nfs shares when requested by remote systems

  the network

<p>

<li> rwalld - allows users to use rwall to write messages on remote
  terminals
  
<p>

<li> rwhod - server which maintains the database used by the rwho(1) and
  ruptime(1) programs. Its operation is predicated on the ability to broadcast
  messages on a network.

<p>

<li> sendmail - mail transfer agent. This is the agent that comes with Red
  Hat. Others, such as smtpd, are not included.

<p>

<li> smb - needed for running SAMBA

<p>

<li> snmpd - provides Simple Network Management Protocol support

<p>

<li> sound - daemon for managing sound

<p>

<li> squid - web page proxy server daemon

<p>

<li> syslogd - manages system log files
  
<p>

<li> smtpd - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, designed for the exchange of
  electronic mail messages. Several daemons that support SMTP are available,
  including sendmail, smtpd, rsmtpd, qmail, zmail, etc.
  
<p>

<li> tcpd - from the tcp_wrappers package. Intercepts requests normally
  handled by inetd and filters them through the files hosts.allow and
  hosts.deny files, which can restrict access to services based on type of
  service, origin of request, destination, etc. Requests are intercepted
  because calls to particular services are replaced with calls to tcpd in
  /etc/inetd.conf.

<p>

<li> telnetd - telnet server daemon

<p>

<li> usb - daemon for devices on Universal Serial Bus

<p>

<li> xfs - X font server

<p>

<li> xinetd - more modern replacement for inetd. It apparently allows for
  similar kinds of access filters to the ones used by tcpd in conjunction with
  inetd. xinetd replaces inetd as the default network services daemon in Red
  Hat 7.0.

<p>

<li> xntpd - Network Time Protocol daemon. Provides a means to syncronize
  time over the network.

<p>

<li> webmin - daemon for webmin web-based system administration program

<p>

<li> ypbind - NIS binder. Needed if computer is part of Network Information 
Service domain.

8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Window Managers</h2>

<p>
The ``Window Managers for X'' site is extremely useful for keeping track of
new Linux window managers. See <a href="http://winman.org"><tt>http://winman.org</tt></a>.

<p>

<ul>  
<li> Afterstep - Based on Fvwm. Designed to give a similar look and feel to
  the NextStep interface.
  
<p>

<li> AnotherLevel - a custom configuration for fvwm2 which mimics the look
  and feel of Windows95.

<p>

<li> Blackbox - a light, fast, window manager. It doesn't clutter the screen
  with too much junk, but it gets the job done efficiently.
  
<p>

<li> CDE - Common Desktop Environment. This is the default window manager on
  many commercial Unix systems. There is no free version.
  
<p>

<li> Enlightenment - Very configurable, and probably the coolest looking
  window manager, but a bit of a resource hog.
  
<p>

<li> Flwm - Fast, Light Window Manager. It has very few features, but is
  very small.
  
<p>

<li> Fvwm - F (?) Virtual Window Manager. This, along with Fvwm2, are old
  standbies in the Linux world. They are quite configurable, but configuration
  involves editing text files which are sometimes obscure.

<p>

<li> Fvwm2 - newer version of above.
  
<p>

<li> Fvwm95 - implementation of Fvwm2 configured to look and feel like
  Windows 95.
  
<p>

<li> Gnome - Gnome desktop environment. A themable collection of desktop
  utilities that can be used with different window managers. The current
  default window manager for a gnome session is Sawfish.
  
<p>

<li> Icewm - Ice Window Manager. Very small, very fast, quite configurable.
  On low memory/small hard drive machines, this one is my favorite.
  Configuration involves editing text files, but the syntax is extremely easy
  to understand. There are also a couple of third-party programs available
  which allow the user to configure Icewm using a graphical interface.
  
<p>

<li> KDE - K Desktop Environment. Many of the desktop utilities can be run
  under different window managers. I may be wrong, but I believe kikbd is the
  only program out there that allows the user to reconfigure the keyboard
  layout to different national keyboards on the fly, with one-click switching
  from one to the other. Unfortunately, this utility is no longer available
  under KDE 2.x.

<p>

<li> Kwm - the window manager that comes with the KDE desktop environment.

<p>

<li> Mwm - Motif window manager.

<p>

<li> Olwm - Open Look window manager.
  
<p>

<li> Sawfish - a small, efficient, configurable window manager that is now
  the default window manager with Gnome.

<p>

<li> Twm - Tab window manager.
  
<p>

<li> UDE - Unix Desktop Environment. In early development stages. An attempt
  to create a new type of desktop environment for Unix machines, including
  Linux.
  
<p>

<li> Windowmaker - One of the more popular window managers. Highly
  configurable and themable.
  
<p>

<li> XFce - ``Cholesterol-Free Desktop Environment''. Includes its own
  window manager, a toolbar, a sound manager, a background manager, and a file
  manager. It has tearoff menus, up to twelve virtual desktops, etc. It is
  completely configurable with menus. Its toolbar looks like the one in CDE. I
  find it easy to use and to configure, and easy on system resources.

<p>
</ul>       <h2><a name="tth_sEc9">
9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alphabetical List of Principal Commands</h2>

<p>
In the following command list, the distinction between upper case and lower
case letters <em>is</em> important. Most of the commands are utilities that are
run by invoking their own executable files. In some cases, they are commands
which are internal to a shell such as bash (shell builtins). The shell
builtins are indicated. There are now many utilities that are included with
either the Gnome or the KDE desktop environments, so many that it would be
difficult to include them all here. In many cases, they duplicate the
functionality of one or more of the programs listed below. I would suggest
consulting the online documentation for these packages.

<p>
Another good source of information on commands is the CTDP (2000b) document.
There are different chapters which group commands in different categories.

<p>
On rpm-based systems, to find out which package owns the command <tt>foo</tt>
(where <tt>foo</tt> is a standalone executable), use the command <tt>rpm
  -q -f foo</tt>.

<p>

<ul>
<li> a2p - translation utility from awk to Perl

<p>

<li> a2ps - translation utility from ``any'' to Postscript

<p>

<li> ac - print statistics concerning user connect time

<p>

<li> access - determine whether a file can be accessed

<p>

<li> acroread - Adobe utility for viewing pdf files

<p>

<li> adduser - used by root to add user to system

<ul>

<li> usage: adduser <em>userid</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> afio - utility to copy or restore files to an archive file. This
utility is not part of the basic internal and external programs under
Red Hat Linux. It is available as an rpm on the rpmfind.net site.

<p>

<li> agetty - enables login on terminals. See getty, mgetty, and uugetty.

<p>

<li> ali - list mail aliases

<p>

<li> alias - assign name to specified command list. This is actually a
shell builtin. On my Red Hat system, I have global alias commands in
my /etc/bashrc file and in my &nbsp;/.bashrc file. On my Slackware box, I have
made the rm command a little bit safer with

<ul>

<li> alias rm='rm -i'
</ul>
<p>
so that you can't recursively delete your /dev directory without telling the
system you're sure you want to do it.

<p>

<li> alien - utility to convert to and from different Linux package formats.
  Can handle Debian (deb), Stampede (stp), Red Hat (rpm) and Slackware (tgz)
  packages.

<p>

<li> apropos - display command names based on keyword search

<ul>

<li> usage: apropos <em>keyword</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> apsfilter - printer filter called by lpd to deal with printing
different types of files. This is a fairly sophisticated print filter. It is
not set up by default in Slackware. It used to be available on the second cd
of a Slackware distribution. Since 4.0, it is available as one of the main
packages in the ap set. Read the mail that the installation program sends to
the root user. I believe that Red Hat uses its own printer filters.

<p>

<li> ar - create, modify and extract from archives

<p>

<li> arch - print machine architecture type

<p>

<li> as - the portable GNU assembler

<p>

<li> asapm - AfterStep laptop advanced power management utility

<p>

<li> ash - a shell, a very simple shell program sometimes used on boot
  diskettes since it takes up much less space than bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.

<p>

<li> asload - AfterStep cpu load monitor

<p>

<li> asmail - AfterStep mail checking utility

<p>

<li> asmodem - AfterStep utility to monitor modem status

<p>

<li> aspell - a spell checking program along the lines of ispell

<p>

<li> aspostit - X Window postit note utility

<p>

<li> at - executes a shell script at specified time. Use atq to show
pending jobs, and atrm to remove jobs from the queue.

<ul>

<li> usage: at <em>time</em>

<li> or: at -f file <em>time</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> atq - shows pending jobs queued by at. If run by root, shows
everybody's pending jobs.

<p>

<li> atrm - removes pending jobs queued by at. Use atq to determine the
identities of various jobs.

<ul>

<li> usage: atrm <em>job</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> awk - searches for and process patterns in a file

<p>

<li> banner - print banner to standard output. Syntax is

<ul>

<li> banner [option] [characters]
</ul>
<p>

<li> bash - Bourne again shell. This is the default shell in the Red Hat
installation.

<p>

<li> batch - queue, examine, or delete jobs for later execution. See at.

<p>

<li> bc - a language (compiler) similar to C, with unlimited precision
arithmetic

<p>

<li> bg PID - send process with pid ``PID'' to the background. This is
the same as executing <tt>[Ctrl]z</tt> while interacting with the running
process. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> bh - puts a job in the background. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> biff - mail notification utility. Notifies user of mail arrival and
sender's name.

<p>

<li> bind - displays or redefines key bindings. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> bison - parser generator similar to yacc
  
<p>

<li> bru - a powerful backup utility program. Commercial. Demonstration
  versions are often included with Linux distributions such as Red Hat.

<p>

<li> bsh - equivalent to ash

<p>

<li> bunzip2 - used to uncompress files compressed with bzip2

<p>

<li> byacc - parser generator

<p>

<li> bzless - view bzipped files

<p>

<li> c++ - invokes GNU C and C++ compiler

<p>

<li> cal - displays a 12-month calendar for the given year or a one-month
calendar of the given month

<ul>

<li> usage: cal <em>month year</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> cat - combine, copy standard input to standard output. Used to join
or display files.

<p>

<li> cd - change working directory. This is a shell builtin in bash,
tcsh and zsh.

<p>

<li> cdplay - command line utility for playing audio cds

<p>

<li> cfdisk - similar to fdisk, but menu-driven

<p>

<li> chat - used to interact with a modem via a chat script

<p>

<li> chgrp - changes group associated with file. Can be used to change the
group associated with subdirectories and files of a directory.

<ul>

<li> usage: chgrp <em>group files</em>

<li> or: chgrp -R <em>group files</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> chkconfig - Query or update system services/daemons for different 
runlevels. Manipulates the various symbolic links in /etc/rc.d. This utility 
is included with many rpm-based distributions such as RedHat and Mandrake. It
is designed to work with System V initialization scripts. Graphical tools for
configuring system services include ntsysv, tksysv and ksysv (the latter is a
KDE utility).

<p>

<li> chmod - set permissions (modes) of files or directories. A value of 4
is used for read permission. A value of 2 is used for write permission. A
value of 1 is used for execute permission. See umask for default file
permissions upon file creation. Chmod can also be used to change the suid bit
on files. The syntax for the symbolic version is

<ul>

<li> chmod [options] who operation permission file-list
</ul>
<p>
The syntax for the absolute version is

<ul>

<li> chmod [options] mode file-list
</ul>
<p>
To set the uid to the owner's permissions, use

<ul>

<li> chmod u +s file-name
</ul>
<p>
To set the uid to the group's permissions, use

<ul>

<li> chmod g +s file-name
</ul>
<p>
There are lots of security issues related to allowing a program to have
root's permissions when run by an ordinary user. I don't pretend to
understand all of these issues.

<p>

<li> chown - changes ownership of a file. Can be used recursively.

<ul>

<li> usage: chown <em>userid files</em>

<li> or: chown -R <em>userid files</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> chsh - change default shell

<p>

<li> ci - creates or records changes in an RCS file

<p>

<li> clear - clear screen command

<p>

<li> cmp - compares two files for differences

<ul>

<li> usage: cmp <em>file1 file2</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> co - retrieves an unencoded version of an RCS file

<p>

<li> comm - compares sorted files

<p>

<li> configure - automatically configures software source code

<p>

<li> color-xterm - color xterm program. Under Red Hat, this is just a
link to xterm-color.

<p>

<li> control-panel - graphical system configuration tool under Red Hat.

<p>

<li> cp - copies on or more files. Recursive copying is one simple way
of archiving part of a directory structure. Use the command as follows:

<ul>

<li> cp -r /sourcedirectory /targetdirectory
</ul>
<p>

<li> cpio - direct copy of files to an output device. Allows creation of
archive file spanning multiple diskettes. Allows one directory structure
to be mirrored elsewhere on the partition or on another partition. In
order to back up an entire directory structure on diskettes, cd to the
directory and use the following command:

<ul>

<li> find . -depth -print <font face="symbol">|</font
> cpio -ov  &gt;  /dev/fd0
</ul>
<p>
To restore from diskettes, use:

<ul>

<li> cpio -iv  &lt;  /dev/fd0
</ul>
<p>
The cpio command will prompt the user to insert more diskettes as they are
needed. The command for mirroring a directory structure is the following:

<ul>

<li> find . -depth -print <font face="symbol">|</font
> cpio -pv /destinationdirectory
</ul>
<p>
This copies the working directory and its contents, including
subdirectories, into /destinationdirectory. In order to copy an individual
file which is larger than a floppy, use:

<ul>

<li> find . -name nameoffile -print <font face="symbol">|</font
> cpio -iv  &gt;  /dev/fd0
</ul>
<p>

<li> cpkgtool - Slackware tool to install, uninstall and query packages.
Front end to installpkg, removepkg, makepkg. This is the graphical version
that uses ncurses.

<p>

<li> cpp - GNU C-compatible compiler preprocessor

<p>

<li> crontab - schedules command to run at regularly specified time

<p>

<li> csh - run C shell

<p>

<li> csplit - separate files into sections. See also split.

<p>

<li> cvs - manages concurrent acces to files in a hierarchy. Stands for
concurrent version system. Is built on RCS. It stores successive revisions
of files efficiently and ensures that access to files by multiple
developers is done in a controlled manner. Useful when many developers are
working on the same project.

<p>

<li> cut - selects characters or TAB-separated fields from lines of input
and writes them to standard output

<p>

<li> date - displays or sets date and time

<ul>

<li> usage: date

<li> or: date <em>date</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> dd - direct copy of file from one device to another. Can be used
to make copies of boot or root diskettes for installing Linux. It can
be used, for example, to make and exact copy of a floppy disk, as
follows. First, place the diskette to be copied in the floppy drive. Then,

<ul>

<li> dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512  &gt;  floppy.copy

<li> Replace the diskette with a fresh diskette.

<li> dd if=floppy.copy bs=512 of=/dev/fd0
</ul>
<p>
The ibs and bs options specify the block sizes for input and for both
input and output. A boot disk image can be directly copied to a floppy
using the second of the two dd commands above.

<p>

<li> declare - declares attributes for a variable (same as
typeset). This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> df - displays capacity and free capacity on different physical
devices such as hard drive partitions and floppy drives that are mounted on
the file system. Gives free space in blocks. With the (undocumented) option
-h, the program gives free space in Mb or Gb. This is useful for those
accustomed to thinking of the capacity of a high-density 3.5 inch diskette
as 1440k.

<p>

<li> diff - displays differences between two files

<ul>

<li> usage: diff <em>file1 file2</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> diff3 - compares three files and reports on differences

<p>

<li> dip - used to set up a SLIP or PPP connection. It can be used
to set up an outgoing SLIP connection or an incoming connection.

<p>

<li> diplogin - used for setting up incoming dip connections. See
the man page for dip.

<p>

<li> dir - a variation of the GNU ls command that defaults to printing
file names in columns

<p>

<li> dircolors - set colors for GNU ls command. In Slackware, this command
is run by the /etc/profile script. Then, whenever xterm is run with the -ls
(login shell) option, ls displays different colors for different types of
files. Typical usage is eval `dircolors -b`. In Red Hat and Mandrake, I get
color directories by aliasing the ls command (see below).

<p>

<li> display - set display for output of programms under X Windows. Can be
used to run a program on a remote machine while displaying the output on a
local machine. The remote machine must have permission to send output to the
local machine. This is actually an environment variable. See the more
detailed discussion in connection with the xhost command below.

<p>

<li> dmesg - displays messages from /var/log relative to the most recent
boot

<p>

<li> dos - invoke the DOSEMU DOS emulator

<p>

<li> du - displays information on disk usage. The command

<ul>

<li> du / -bh | less
</ul>
<p>
will display detailed disk usage for each subdirectory starting at root,
giving files sizes in bytes.

<p>

<li> dumpkeys - print information about the keyboard driver's translation
tables to standard output

<p>

<li> dvilj - send a dvi file to a Laserjet printer. There are
specialized versions for individual models of Laserjet printer.

<p>

<li> dvilj2p - specialized version of dvilj for the IIp series of
printers. See above.

<p>

<li> dvips - send a dvi file to a Postscript printer, to a Postscript
capable Laserjet printer, or to a file (with the -o option). There is a
switch to print only a subset of the pages, and another switch to print in
landscape mode. Use -t landscape, which is one of the arguments to the paper
type switch. If you have one page of a document that is a wide table, and
you wish to print this in landscape mode, use

<ul>

<li> dvips <em>filename -pp pagenumber -t landscape</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> e2fsck - check an ext2 filesystem. The syntax is

<ul>

<li> e2fsck <em>/dev/devicename</em>
</ul>
<p>
where the filesystem is on /dev/devicename. The device should not be mounted,
and this program must be run as root.

<p>

<li> echo - write arguments to standard output. One use is to print out
information about environment variables, as in

<ul>

<li> echo $PATH - list paths to search

<li> echo $HOME or echo <tt>~</tt> - list name of home directory
</ul>
<p>
This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications. Allows
the user to change X resources for individual applications.

<p>

<li> efax - fax program

<p>

<li> efix - convert between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale formats

<p>

<li> egrep - search files for lines that match regular expressions. Runs
faster than grep and fgrep.

<p>

<li> elm - an interactive mail system

<p>

<li> elvis - a version of the vi text editor

<p>

<li> emacs - screen oriented text editor

<p>

<li> env - desplay the current environment or set a variable equal to a
new value

<p>

<li> eval - scans and evaluates the command line. See dircolors
command. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> ex - interactive command-based editor. The man page lists it as being
the same as vim, an improved version of vi.

<p>

<li> exec - system call which creates a subshell to execute a binary or a
script. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> execve - a variation of the exec command.

<p>

<li> exit - exit a shell. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> expand - convert tabs in files to spaces and write to standard output

<p>

<li> expect -  a program that ``talks'' to other interactive programs
according to a script. Following the script, Expect knows what can be 
expected from a program and what the correct response should be. An
interpreted language provides branching and high-level control  structures
to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take  control and
interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.

<p>

<li> export - place the value of a variable in the calling environment
(makes it global). This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> expr - utility evaluates an expression and displays the result

<p>

<li> f2c - FORTRAN to C translator

<p>

<li> f77 - FORTRAN 77 compiler

<p>

<li> file - displays classification of a file or files according to the
type of data they contain

<p>

criteria. The find command that I use the most is

<ul>

<li> find . -name filename -print
</ul>
<p>
in order to find files matching a particular name on the working directory
and all subdirectories. Find can be incredibly powerful, but it is
incredibly obscure.

<p>

<li> fmt - simple text formatting utility. Tries to make all nonblank
lines nearly the same length.

<p>

builtin.

<p>

<li> getkeycodes - print kernel's scancode-to-keycode mapping table

<p>

<li> ghostscript - set of printing utilities. It seems to be obligatory to
have this if a T<sub>E</sub>X installation such as teT<sub>E</sub>X is installed. How they
communicate with one another is somewhat obscure.

<p>

<li> ghostview - Aladdin ghostscript interpreter/previewer

<p>

<li> gimp - image manipulation and paint program

<p>

<li> glint - Red Hat graphical front end for the rpm package installer and
manager.

<p>

<li> grep - used to find a string within a file. The -i option returns
matches without regard to case. The -n option means that each line of output
is preceded by file name and line number. The -v option causes non-matched
lines to be printed.

<ul>

<li> usage: grep <em>pattern files</em>

<li> or: grep -i <em>pattern files</em>

<li> or: grep -n <em>pattern files</em>

<li> or: grep -v <em>pattern files</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> groupadd - create a new group on the system

<p>

<li> groups - shows which groups you are in
  
<p>

<li> grub - Gnu grand unified bootloader. Can be used instead of lilo to
  boot multiple operating systems. I encountered a couple of snafus trying to
  install grub on my home machine after installing Mandrake 8.0 and choosing
  the lilo bootloader during the initial install. The Mandrake installation
  program set up /boot/vmlinuz as a symlink to the actual kernel,
  vmlinuz-2.4.3-20mdk. It took me a while to figure out that grub doesn't
  understand symbolic links. The documentation suggests installing grub on a
  diskette using the ``dd'' command. This refused to work, but
  
<ul>
  
<li> grub-install '(fd0)'
  </ul>
<p>
  did work. The single quotes are necessary. The files necessary to run grub
  are normally located in /boot/grub. Once the file menu.lst has been edited
  and appropriated entries added to boot the different operating systems on
  one's hard disk(s), the following sequence of commands can be used to
  install grub in the master boot record (MBR) sector of the hard disk:
  
<ul>
  
<li> root (hd0,<em>x</em>)
  
<li> setup (hd0)
  </ul>
<p>
  Here, the <em>x</em> should be replaced by the partition where the /boot/grub
  directory is located, which is probably the root partition of the Linux
  system. Note that grub has its own conventions for naming devices and
  numbering partitions, so that for example a partition which is called hda6
  under Linux will be called (hd0,5) by grub.

<p>

are currently active. First ethernet interface should be listed as
eth0, second as eth1, etc. First modem ppp connection should be listed
as ppp0, etc. The ``lo'' connection is ``loopback'' only.

<p>

<li> ifdown - shut down the network interface

run-time linker, ld.so) to the most recent shared libraries found in the
directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in
the trusted directories (/usr/lib and /lib). Ldconfig checks the header and
file names of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions
should have their links updated. Ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning
for libraries.

<p>

<li> ldd - list the shared libraries on which a given executable depends,
and where they are located

<p>

<li> leave - display reminder at specified time

<p>

<li> less - Linux alternative to ``more'' command. Displays text files,
one screenful at a time. When less pauses, there is a large number of
available commands to tell it what to do next. One can scroll both
forwards and backwards.

<p>

<li> let - evaluates a numeric expression. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> lilo - installs boot loader on the boot sector of a hard drive, of a
diskette, or in another location. My 486 has a hard drive that is too
large for the machine's BIOS, so I have to boot from a floppy. To create a
boot diskette, I do the following (as root):

<ul>

<li> /sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0H1440

<li> /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0

<li> mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

<li> cp -dp /boot/* /mnt/floppy

<li> /sbin/lilo -C /etc/lilo.flop
</ul>
<p>
The -C option to lilo has lilo use the lilo.flop file instead of the
default lilo.conf.

<p>

<li> linuxconf - interactive tool for configuring Linux system. Uses X
if loaded. This is a Gnome tool. It comes with my Red Hat distribution, and
is not included with Slackware. It would seem to be the easiest way to
configure Linux under Slackware. Version 1.15 is available for Slackware.
There is a pretty good introduction to the use of linuxconf in the Red Hat
5.2 installation manual, which is available online at their web site.

<p>

<li> ln - creates a link to a file. Used to create hard links and, with
the -s option, symbolic links which can link files on different disk
partitions. The syntax is

<ul>

<li> ln [options] source [dest]
</ul>
<p>

<li> locate filename - find the file name which contains the string
``filename''. The syntax is easier than the find command.

<p>

<p>

<li> lprm - cancel a job from print queue

<p>

<li> ls - list directory contents. To get colored directory listings
under Red Hat, Mandrake, etc., use

<ul>

<li> ls -color
</ul>
<p>
To get this all the time, add

<ul>

<li> alias ls='ls -color=auto'
</ul>
<p>
to .bashrc. The following command

<ul>

<li> alias ls='ls -Fskb -color=auto'
</ul>
<p>
will give directory listings in color, with file sizes in kilobytes, and
append a character to the file to indicate its type.

<p>

<li> lsattr - list attributes of files in ext2 file system

<p>

<li> lsmod - used (by root) to show kernel modules currently loaded

<p>

devices attached to them. Part of the pciutils package that comes with many 
Linux distributions.

<p>

<li> lspnp - utility to display information about pnp devices. Part of the 
pcmcia or kernel-pcmcia package, depending on the distribution.

<p>

<li> m4 - an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor. It
can be used with the sendmail configuration package in Red Hat (and
Slackware) to generate a sendmail.conf configuration file without having to
edit the configuration file directly.

<p>

<li> magicfilter - general purpose printer filter. See apsfilter
above. apsfilter is the printer filter that comes with the Red Hat
and Slackware distributions.

<p>

<li> mail - sends or reads electronic mail

<p>

<li> make - keeps a set of programs current. This is a utility that helps
when developing a set of programs. It works by executing a script called
makefile, Makefile or GNUmakefile in the working directory. It is very
often used in combination with configure when compiling and installing
noncompiled software packages.

<p>

<li> makebootdisk - command in Slackware to do just what the name says

<p>

<li> nice program_name - sets the priority of the program
``program_name''.

<p>

<li> nm - lists the symbols from object files objfile. If no object
files are given as arguments, nm assumes `a.out'.

<p>

<li> nohup - runs a command that keeps running after logout. The command is
in principle immune to hangups, and must have output to a non tty. According
to <em>Linux in a Nutshell</em>, this is necessary only in the Bourne shell,
since modern shells preserve background processes by default.

<p>

<li> ntsysv - run level editor under Red Hat. This is the equivalent
of tksysv, but does not require a graphical interface.

<p>

<li> nxterm - color xterm program. The man page for nxterm under Red Hat
brings up the same page as xterm.

<p>

<li> od - dumps contents of a file

<p>

<li> passwd - change login password

separate program.

<p>

<li> perl - practical extraction and report language

<p>

Front end to installpkg, removepkg, makepkg. The cpkgtool is the ncurses
graphical version of this program.

<p>

<li> popclient - retrieve mail via the Post Office Protocol. Supports POP2
and POP3.

<p>

<li> popd - pops the top directory of the directory stack and uses cd to
change to that directory. This is a shell builtin.

<li> pr - paginates files for printing

<p>

<li> printenv - display list of environment variables

<p>

<li> printtool - run (as root) in an X terminal to configure your
printer(s)

<p>

<li> ps - displays status of processes. Use the -a option for processes
for all users. Use the -x option to include processes not attached to a
terminal.

<p>

<li> pstree - display processes in the form of a tree structure. Killing a
  parent process will also kill all the children and their descendants.

<p>

<li> pushd - pushes the argument onto the top of the directory stack and
uses cd to change to that directory. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

builtin.

<p>

<li> pwchk - checks the integrity of password and shadow files

<p>

<li> pwconv - converts passwords to the shadow password format

<p>

<li> pwunconv - unconverts passwords from the shadow password
  format. Generates a standard Unix password file.

<p>

<li> python - interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language

<p>

<li> rcp - copy one or more files to or from remote computer. The syntax
is poorly explained in the documentation that I have, including the man
pages. Usage is:

<ul>

<li> rcp filename username@remotehost:path
</ul>
<p>
The user's home directory on the remote system must contain the file .rhosts
with a list of users (preceded by the full domain name or exact IP address of
their machine) with access privileges.

<ul>

<li> localhostname username
</ul>
<p>

<li> rcs - creates or changes the attributes of an RCS file. Stands for
Revision Control System.

<p>

<li> rdev - query/set image root device, swap device, RAM disk size, or
video mode in kernel

<p>

<li> read - reads line from standard input. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> readonly - declares a variable to be read only. This is a shell
builtin.

<p>

<li> reboot - in Slackware, reboots the system. Seems to be equivalent to
shutdown -r now in generic Linux.

<p>

<li> renice program_name - resets the priority of process
``program_name''.

<p>

<li> reset - used to reset the screen characteristics. This is useful if
the screen gets messed up from, for example, trying to display a binary
file in an xterm.

<p>

<li> return - exits from a function. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> rlog - prints a summary of the history of an RCS file

<p>

<li> rlogin - log in to remote computer. The general syntax is as
follows, using the UQAM Nobel machine as an example:

<ul>

<li> rlogin -l userid nobel.si.uqam.ca
</ul>
<p>
The remote computer must recognize the local user and the local machine. See
the rcp command for how to set up the .rhosts file on the remote machine.

<p>

<li> rm - remove files or directories. With the -r (recursive) option
(very dangerous!), can be used to remove the contents of a specified
directory including all subdirectories.

<p>

<li> rmail - interpret and handle remote mail received via uucp

<p>

<li> rmdir - remove empty directories

<p>

<li> rmmod - used to remove modular device drivers

<p>

<li> route -n - show routing table. The n option returns numerical
addresses rather than names.

<p>

<li> rpm - invokes the Red Hat package manager in command line mode. I
often use this command in query mode to query packages about what files
they contain and to find out which package owns a particular
file. Examples are

<ul>

<li> rpm -qil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the
package foo.

<li> rpm -qfil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the
package that owns the file foo. Foo must be in the working directory, or the
full path to foo must be specified.
</ul>
<p>
We need to find out about installing the rpm package on a Slackware box.
It's probably better to use a package converter such as alien.

<p>

<li> rpm2tgz - an extremely useful utility on Slackware systems that
converts rpm packages to tgz format. They can then be installed using the
installpkg command (or pkgtool).

<p>

<li> rsh - execute shell command on a remote computer. See rcp and rlogin.

<p>

<li> rstat - summarize host's status: uptime, load averages, and current
time

<p>

<li> ruptime - show host status of local machines

<p>

<li> rusers - list who is logged on local machines

<p>

<li> rwall - write to all users over a network

<p>

<li> rwho - show who is logged in on a LAN. The rwho service must be
enabled for this command to run. If it isn't, run ``setup'' as root. I
don't understand this last remark, which comes from ``Linux Newbie
Administrator Guide''.

<p>

<li> rxvt - a terminal program similar to xterm, but which has less
features and uses less memory

<p>

<li> sed - edits a file (not interactively). Also a tool for processing
text files.

<p>

<li> set - set or display value of shell variables. This is a shell
builtin. The command

<ul>

<li> set | less
</ul>
<p>
prints the current user environment, giving the values of currently
defined variables.

<p>

<li> setenv - set or display value of environment variables

<p>

<li> setserial - used by root to configure a serial port

<p>

<li> setterm - set terminal attributes for a virtual console

<p>

<li> setuid - set the id of a program when it is run. Used, for example,
to give root privileges to a program run by an ordinary user. This is
actually done by running the chmod program as root. See the chmod command
for the syntax.

<p>

<li> setup - Slackware program to set up program sets and configure
system. Setup devices and file systems, mount root file system

<p>

<li> sh - standard UNIX shell. On Linux, just another name for bash.

<p>

<li> shift - promotes each command-line argument. This is a shell builtin.

<p>

<li> showmount - show information about an nfs server

<p>

<li> shutdown - reboot or shut down system as root, after specified amount
of time. With the -r option, reboot. With the -h option, halt the system.

<ul>

<li> usage: shutdown -r <em>minutes</em>
</ul>
<p>

<li> sleep - creates process that sleeps for specified interval

<p>

<li> sliplogin - attaches a SLIP interface to standard input. Used
to allow dialin SLIP connections.

<p>

<li> sort - sorts and/or merge files

<p>

<li> split - split file into specified number of segments

<p>

<li> ssh - secure shell. Apparently has many of the same functionalities
as rlogin, telnet, ftp, rsh, etc., with better security and encryption
features. We may want to learn how to set this up and use it.

<p>

<li> startx - front end to xinit in Linux. This is a script which starts
up X clients and shuts down the X server on exit from the window manager.

<p>

<li> startx <tt>--</tt> :1 - start the next X window session on the
display 1 (the default is opened on display 0). One can switch between
different graphical displays using <tt>[Ctrl][Alt][F7]</tt>,
<tt>[Ctrl][Alt][F8]</tt>, etc.

<p>

<li> stty - sets or displays operating options for terminal

<p>

<li> su - log in as another user, including root

<p>

<li> sudo - allows individual users to have root permission to perform
specified tasks

<p>

<li> sync - writes memory buffers to physical devices

<p>

<li> systat - query host for system information

<p>

<li> tac - print file in reverse

<p>

<li> tail - displays the last part of a file

<p>

<li> talk - visual communication program that copies lines from one terminal
to that of another user

<p>

<li> tar - file compression and archiving utility. I find the syntax of
this command to be frustratingly opaque. The following works for me.  To
use this command to unzip gzipped tarballs in verbose mode, use

<ul>

<li> tar -xvzf filename.tgz
</ul>
<p>
To create a tarball from files in a given directory and its
subdirectories, use

<ul>

<li> tar -cvzf filename.tgz sourcename
</ul>
<p>
Sourcename can be the name of a single file, a wildcard such as *, or the
name of a subdirectory. There seem to be two different conventions
concerning gzipped tarballs. One often encounters .tar.gz. The other
popular choice is .tgz. Slackware packages use the latter convention. The
command can also be used to archive a file, a group of files, or a
directory (with its subdirectories) on tape or onto floppies. If the
material to be archived exceeds the capacity of the backup medium, the
program will prompt the user to insert a new tape or diskette. Use the
following command to back up to floppies:

<ul>

<li> tar -cvf /dev/fd0 filename(s) or directoryname(s)
</ul>
<p>
The backup can be restored with

<ul>

<li> tar -xvf /dev/fd0
</ul>
<p>
Tar can be used for other things. To mirror all the files and
subdirectories in from-stuff to to-stuff, use the commands

<ul>

<li> cd from-stuff

<li> tar cf - . | (cd ../to-stuff; tar xvf -)
</ul>
<p>
No tar file is ever written to disk. The data is sent by pipe from one tar
process to another. This example is taken from <em>Running Linux</em>,
p.177. To list the table of contents of a tar archive, use

<ul>

<li> tar tvf tarfile
</ul>
<p>
To extract individual files from a tar archive, use

<ul>

<li> tar xvf tarfile files
</ul>
<p>
where files is the list of files to extract. When extracting files, tar
creates missing subdirectories underneath the current directory in which the
cammand is invoked.

from the active filesystem. The command umount -a will (re)mount all file
systems listed in /etc/fstab.

<p>

<li> unalias - remove name previously defined by alias. This is a shell
builtin.

<p>
in order to get a graphical login screen on the remote machine. See the
discussion in connection with xdm below.

<p>

<li> xadm - display advanced power management BIOS information

<p>

<li> xargs - converts standard output of one command into arguments for
another. This is one of those powerful but obscure commands. Xargs reads
arguments from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be
protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and
executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any
initial-arguments followed by arguments read from standard input. Blank
lines on the standard input are ignored.

<p>

<li> xbiff - graphical mail delivery notification utility

<p>

<li> xcalc - simple calculator program

<p>

<li> xclipboard - name says it all

<p>

<li> Xconfigurator - Red Hat utility for configuring settings for X

<p>

<li> xdm - used to start an X login session. This can be used to start a
login session on a remote system. See the discussion on the following
site:

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html"><tt>http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html</tt></a>
</ul>
<p>
See the man pages for X, xdm, and Xserver. As usual, the man pages are
pretty obscure. The best single source seems to be the Xserver man pages.
After X is configured, X needs to be started at bootup with the command
(in /etc/rc.d/init.d/xterm):

<ul>

<li> X -quiet -query remotemachineaddress
</ul>
<p>
If the address of a nameserver is not configured, then the numeric address
of the remote machine rather than its name should be entered. If the
machines are connected through ethernet cards and the net, then obviously
basic networking has to be set up. Gnome and KDE come with their own versions
of X display/login managers, called respectively gdm and kdm.

<p>

<li> xdvi - view a dvi file compiled under L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X

<p>

<li> xedit - a simple text editor for X

<p>

<li> xf86config - graphical configuration tool for X

<p>

<li> XF86Setup - graphical configuration tool for X

<p>

<li> xfd - display an available font in X. Creates a grid in an x-term
with one character per rectangle.

<p>

<li> xfig - utility for interactive generation of figures

<p>

<li> xfm - graphical file manager for X

<p>

<li> xhost - tell X server that remote computer has access to your
machine and that you will use the remote computer. This can be used to set
up remote X sessions. To set up a remote X session on the UQAM Nobel
machine, run the following command on the local machine (one doesn't have
to be root to do this)

<ul>

<li> xhost +nobel.si.uqam.ca
</ul>
<p>
Then, log onto the remote machine using rlogin (see above) or telnet. Once
logged in, use the following command to get the remote X server to open an
X terminal on the local machine:

<ul>

<li> setenv DISPLAY localhostname:0 ; xterm &amp;
</ul>
<p>
This is valid for csh, which is the default login shell on Nobel. For ksh,
(and I think bash) replace with

<ul>

<li> DISPLAY=localhostname:0

<li> export DISPLAY ; xterm
</ul>
<p>
Other X-based programs such as Netscape or Gauss (graphical version) can
also be run on a remote machine with display on the local machine with
little trouble. The local X server is the program that has all of the
information concerning the properties of the graphics card and terminal, so
it must be necessary to have X running on the local machine. The following
should also work. After using xhost to give permission to the remote machine
to display on the local machine, use

<ul>

<li> netscape -display localhostname:0.0
</ul>
<p>
Question: can one start the X session on the local machine and then run a
remote copy of a window manager?

<p>

<li> xinit - start X Window. The command startx is a front end to xinit in
Linux, including Slackware.

<p>

<li> xload - displays a graphic of the system load

<p>

<li> xlpq - graphical interface to print manager. This is included on one of
the XFCE menus, but does not seem to be a part of the base Red Hat
distribution.

<p>

<li> xlsfonts - list fonts available under the X Window system.

<p>

<li> xman - browsable command reference. Displays manual pages under X.

<p>

<li> xmh - graphical front end under X to the nmh mail handling
system. This program is part of the XFree86 package in Red Hat.

<p>

<li> xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings
in X. Can be used to install a French Canadian keyboard. Download the
Xmodmap.cf file from www.linux-quebec.org, and insert the command

<ul>

<li> xmodmap /etc/X11/Xmodmap.cf &amp;
</ul>
<p>
into the .xession (with xdm) or the .xinitrc (with startx) file.

<p>

<li> xosview - displays bar graphs of system load, load average, memory
usage, and swap usage

<p>

<li> xpaint - simple paint program for X

<p>

<li> xpdf - GPL'd utility for previewing dvi files. Doesn't seem to
work too well on texts with a lot of math.

<p>

<li> xplaycd - X Window audio cd player utility

<p>

<li> xsetroot - utility to configure root window of an X terminal

<p>

<li> xsysinfo - graphical display of load and memory usage

<p>

<li> xterm - start an X Window terminal session

<p>

<li> xterm-color - color version of xterm

<p>

<li> xv - utility for viewing and manipulating many types of image
files. This is a shareware program.

<p>

<li> xvidtune - utility for fine tuning of monitor settings under X

<p>

<li> yacc - parser generator

<p>

<li> ytalk - multi-user program similar to talk

<p>

<li> zcat - read one or more files that have been compressed with gzip or
compress and write to standard output

<p>

<li> zcmp - read compressed files and pass them to cmp

<p>

<li> zdiff - read compressed files and pass them to diff

<p>

<li> zgrep - read compressed files and pass them to grep

<p>

<li> Zharf - AfterStep button panel module

<p>

<li> zip - zip utility compatible with DOS PKzip

<p>

<li> zless - view zipped files

<p>

<li> zmore - print contents of compressed files one screen at a time

<p>

<li> znew - uncompress Z files and recompress in .gz format

<p>
</ul>Eventually, we want to be able to distinguish between commands that are an
intrinsic part of the kernel, commands that are executable binaries that
come with every distribution of Linux, executable binaries that are not
provided with all distributiions of Linux, and executable shell scripts. We
also want to point out the typical location of these commands on different
Linux distributions. Finally, we want to distinguish between shell commands
and Linux commands.

10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes on Applications</h2>

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc10.1">
10.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)</h3>

<p>
The Linux distributions I know come with sendmail, except for Mandrake, which
as of version 7.1 uses Postfix as its default MTA. There are several competing
programs available. Even the simplest don't seem to be that easy to configure.

<p>

<ul>
<li> Exim -

<p>

<li> Fetchmail - seemingly one of the few ways (Pine is able to do this as
well) to download mail automatically from a POP or IMAP server and pass it to
local mail handling agents. Use the following line in &nbsp;/.fetchmailrc:

<ul>

<li> poll pop.uqam.ca proto pop3 user USERNAME pass PASSWORD
</ul>
<p>
Use the following to have fetchmail loaded as a daemon that will download
mail at regular intervals:

<ul>

<li> fetchmail -d 6000
</ul>
<p>
The interval is specified in seconds. Fetchmail will poll all of the pop
servers listed in &nbsp;/.fetchmailrc.

<p>

<li> Getmail - Designed as a replacement for Fetchmail.

<p>

<li> MMDF -

<p>

<li> Postfix - a mail transport agent and potential replacement for
sendmail. Mandrake 7.1 and up uses this as its default MTA.

<p>

<li> Qmail - a ``modern'' replacement for sendmail. It is reputed to be
more secure than sendmail. Since it doesn't have a GPL license, it is not the
default MTA of any Linux distributions that I know of.

<p>

<li> Sendmail - this one gets my vote for the most complicated and obscure
configuration file, /etc/sendmail.cf. Most individual Linux users will be
using machines connected to the Internet via an ISP or on networks (such
as university networks) with centralized mail processing and access to the
net. I have to change the following lines in sendmail.cf to be able to
send mail with emacs.

<ul>

<li> DMuqam.ca          <tt>#</tt> masquerade the domain name

<li> DNambler.steven    <tt>#</tt> masquerade username

<li> DSnobel.si.uqam.ca <tt>#</tt> relay all mail through nobel server
</ul>
<p>
The problem comes from the fact that, as a user on a local network, I
don't have my own domain name. I want return mail to be routed to
UQAM's mail server and I want the server to handle all my mail for me,
even mail to other UQAM users. If I send mail to UQAM users using
their normalized usernames, the net does not know who or where they
are. I have managed to get a configuration that works by writing a
sendmail.mc file and processing it with the m4 macro interpreter,
following the Address-Rewriting mini-HOWTO. I now have something that
works, but which mysteriously complains about ``dangerous write
permissions'' every time the system boots up.

<p>

<li> Smail - seems to be a popular choice on smaller systems. It
would appear that at one point in its history, Red Hat shipped with
smail, but this has been replaced with sendmail.

<p>

<li> Zmailer - apparently designed for mail servers with a large number
of users.

<p>
</ul>     <h3><a name="tth_sEc10.2">
10.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mail User Agents (MUAs)</h3>

<p>

<ul>
<li> Acmemail - Web-based mail agent. Allows you to access your mail
with any browser. Involves setting up a Perl CGI script on the server
side.

<p>

<li> Archimedes - A successor program to XFmail (see below)

<p>

<li> Arrow -

<p>

<li> Balsa - the default Gnome mail program

<p>

<li> Blitzmail -

<p>

<li> Elm -

<p>

<li> Emumail - Web-based mail agent. Allows you to use any browser
to check your POP mail account. The Web site of the company that makes
this one can be used to check your mail on a Unix system without
setting up any CGI script on the server side.

<p>

<li> Evolution - mail reader and contact manager/calendar designed for use
  under Gnome

<p>

<li> Exmh - graphical front end for Mh

<p>

<li> Kmail - mail reading program included with KDE

<p>

<li> M - for ``Mahogany''. Seems similar to XFmail (see below). I
haven't been able to figure out from the description whether it runs
independently of or in conjunction with sendmail and procmail.

<p>

<li> Mh -

<p>

<li> Mumail -

<p>

<li> Mutt - text based mail program, which is highly configurable.

<p>

<li> Nmh - mail handling system. This system includes a <em>large</em>
number of binary commands that are kept in /usr/bin. See the man page for
nmh for details. Red Hat 5.1 and 5.2 come with exmh and xmh, which are
graphical front ends for nmh. The exmh front end is a separate package,
while xmh is owned by XFree86.

<p>

<li> Pine - text based mail and news utility. Features now include:

<ul>

<li> MIME support

<li> ability to read and post network news

<li> maintenance of an address book of mail recipients

<li> spell checking during message composition

<li> mouse support when using xterm on an X Window system

<li> a highly configurable environment
</ul>
<p>
Pine can be used to download mail from one or more POP3 mail servers. See Tip
of the Week (<a href="http://tipoftheweek.darkelf.net"><tt>http://tipoftheweek.darkelf.net</tt></a>) for the fourth week of
February 1999. First, set up multiple configuration files (pine -p localmail,
pine -p popserver 1, pine -p popserver 2, etc.). Then, to configure Pine to
use a POP3 server, use the Setup Config command. Set something like this in
the inbox-path:

<ul>

<li> {pop.server.com/pop3/user=myid}INBOX
</ul>
<p>
When Pine is restarted, it should ask for your password, connect to the
remote server, and use it is if it were accessing local mail. The article
is unclear on whether there is the option of leaving copies of the
downloaded mail on the server.

<p>

<li> Sylpheed -

<p>

<li> XCmail -
  
<p>

<li> XFmail - This one seems very promising. It's a GUI-based mail tool that
  seems to offer most of the features of Netscape's mail module. It runs
  without using sendmail and procmail, which is a major advantage.

<p>
</ul>     <h3><a name="tth_sEc10.3">
10.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Editors</h3>

<p>

<ul>
<li> cooledit - a pretty powerful GUI text editor
  
<p>

<li> emacs - powerful text editor that includes modules for reading and
  sending mail and postings to newsgroups, and a browser module. For editing
  T<sub>E</sub>X and L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X files, the AucT<sub>E</sub>X addon package is invaluable, and
  makes emacs pretty hard to beat as an editor with L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X.

<p>

<li> jed - has pretty good emacs emulation (it can even read mail like
  emacs!). It does simple syntax highlighting for TeX files, including giving
  positioning of parentheses. It would seem to be pretty configurable and
  takes up much less disk space than emacs, although more than joe and
  muemacs. It works well in console mode, and still manages to use colors for
  menu bars and syntax highlighting. The program xjed which comes with some
  versions starts up its own X terminal when invoked.
  
<p>

<li> joe - "Joe's Own Editor", a fairly powerful editor with a compact
  binary and an ability to emulate Wordstar, Emacs, Pico, and a few other
  editors.
  
<p>

<li> jove - "Joe's Own Version of Emacs". I tried this out a couple of times
  and managed to crash it when making some minor errors in command syntax.
  
<p>

<li> microemacs (JASSPA) - spinoff of muemacs. Pretty powerful and
  configurable, while not taking up too much disk space or memory.
  
<p>

<li> muemacs - a fairly powerful emacs clone whose binary is actually
  smaller than that of the Joe editor.
  
<p>

<li> nedit - an X Window based text editor. Of all text editors for Linux
  that I've seen, it has commands which are closest to Windows text editors,
  for cursor movement, highlighting, marking text, etc. It has very good
  syntax highlighting for both L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X and HTML.

<p>

<li> pico - simple text editor. It often comes packaged with the Pine mail
  user agent.
  
<p>

<li> vi - included with most Linux distributions. If you're not used to the
  syntax, it can be pretty hard to understand.

<p>

<li> vim - improved version of vi

<p>

<li> xedit - simple text editor included with many Linux distributions

<p>
</ul>     <h3><a name="tth_sEc10.4">
10.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other</h3>

<p>

<ul>
<li> dfm - Desktop File Manager. Allows the user to place program icons on
the desktop.

<p>

<li> gmc - Gnome Midnight Commander. Gnome version of Midnight
Commander. Includes a graphical interface and allows the user to place icons
on the desktop.

<p>

<li> mc - Midnight Commander file manager. Runs in console mode and in an
xterm.

<p>

<li> scilab - a free matrix programming language. May be a good substitute
for GAUSS and/or MATLAB.
